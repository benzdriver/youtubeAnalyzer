# Container Stability Report - Phase 1 Integration Testing

## Executive Summary
**Date**: June 6, 2025  
**Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Core infrastructure stable, auxiliary services unstable

## Container Status Analysis

### ✅ Stable Containers (3/6)
- **Backend API**: Healthy, responding to requests
- **PostgreSQL**: Healthy, database connections working
- **Redis**: Healthy, cache operations functional

### ❌ Unstable Containers (2/6)
- **Frontend**: Continuous restart loop due to permission denied errors accessing `/app/.next/trace`
- **Celery Beat**: Continuous restart loop due to permission denied errors accessing `celerybeat-schedule`

### ⚠️ Partially Functional (1/6)
- **Celery Worker**: Running but unhealthy status

## Root Cause Analysis

### Permission Issues
Both unstable containers suffer from Docker user/group ID mismatches:

**Frontend Container Error:**
```
errno: -13,
code: 'EACCES',
syscall: 'open',
path: '/app/.next/trace'
```

**Celery Beat Container Error:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'celerybeat-schedule'
```

### Attempted Solutions
1. **Named Volumes**: Configured `frontend_next` and `celery_beat_schedule` volumes
2. **tmpfs Mounting**: Used tmpfs for `.next` directory with specific permissions
3. **Alternative Paths**: Moved schedule file to `/tmp/celerybeat-schedule`
4. **PID File Configuration**: Added separate pidfile location

### Technical Assessment
The permission issues appear to stem from:
- Container user running as non-root but needing write access to mounted directories
- Host filesystem permissions not matching container user expectations
- Next.js build process requiring write access to `.next` directory
- Celery beat scheduler requiring write access to schedule database file

## Impact on Phase 1 Testing

### Functional Components ✅
- API endpoints accessible and responding
- Database connectivity established
- Redis caching operational
- Core backend services functional

### Non-Functional Components ❌
- Frontend UI not accessible via browser
- Scheduled task execution not operational
- Real-time WebSocket connections may be affected

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Proceed with API Testing**: Core backend functionality can be tested
2. **Document Known Limitations**: Record container stability issues
3. **Test Available Components**: Focus on backend, database, Redis integration

### Future Resolution
1. **Dockerfile User Configuration**: Add proper user/group setup
2. **Volume Ownership**: Configure proper volume ownership in docker-compose
3. **Development vs Production**: Consider different configurations for environments

## Phase 1 Completion Status
- **Backend Integration**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Database Integration**: ✅ Ready for testing  
- **Configuration Management**: ✅ Ready for testing
- **Container Orchestration**: ⚠️ Partial - core services functional
- **Frontend Integration**: ❌ Blocked by container issues
- **Task Scheduling**: ❌ Blocked by container issues

## Conclusion
Phase 1 can proceed with testing of stable components (50% of infrastructure) while documenting container stability limitations for future resolution.
